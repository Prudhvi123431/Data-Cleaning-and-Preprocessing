##🧠 Overview


The objective was to clean and prepare a raw dataset for analysis using Excel and/or Python (Pandas). I chose the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset from Kaggle and performed a series of preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and consistency.


📌 Task: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

🎯 Objective

The goal of this task is to clean and prepare a raw dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and incorrect data types.

🛠 Tools Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy) / Excel

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab/ VS Code


📂 Steps Performed

1. Handled Missing Values

Checked for nulls using .isnull() (Python) / filters (Excel).

Treated missing values using dropna() or fillna().



2. Removed Duplicates

Applied .drop_duplicates() (Python) / "Remove Duplicates" (Excel).



3. Standardized Text Values

Cleaned inconsistent entries (e.g., gender → Male/Female, country names).



4. Fixed Date Formats

Converted all dates to a consistent format: DD-MM-YYYY.



5. Renamed Column Headers

Used lowercase, replaced spaces with underscores.



6. Checked & Corrected Data Types

Converted numerical columns (e.g., age → int).

Converted date columns to datetime.




📊 Suitable Dataset (Kaggle)


Netflix Movies and TV Shows


🚀 Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience with real-world data cleaning.

Improved understanding of data preprocessing.

Confidence in preparing datasets for analysis & modeling.
